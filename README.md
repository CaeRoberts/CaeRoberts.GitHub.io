#    Links-Based Landing Page & Portfolio üñ•Ô∏è

The Links-Based Landing Page & Portfolio is my front facing digital representation of my projects and links to social medias. 

## Description üìì

Thanks for visiting my GitHub, you can access the Landing Page / Portfolio [here](https://caeroberts.github.io/). The project is divided into 4 sections. 

Section  | Description
------------- | -------------
Links Page  | A fast, easy to use button-based links page with quick links to personal social media pages & portfolio items.
Portfolio Section  | Card based portfolio displaying basic information about each project. Including Overview, Role and buttons to live websites / GitHub pages.
About Section  | Condensed 'About' section using DOM manipulation to show/hide section. Includes snazzy photo of me, basic description & a distinct lack of humour!
Hire Section  | Hidden area accessed through the banner above the links section. Includes basic rundown of skills, languages & frameworks, quick-jump to portfolio & access to my CV.
